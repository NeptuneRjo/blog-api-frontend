# Reflection

This is the second half of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api) Blog API project in the Nodejs section.
Project goals included building a frontend application that consumed the previously built Nodejs API. To make this project more rigorous, Typescript was included
as a tool to be learned while building the app.

The most challenging part was building a React app with Typescript, particularly the intricacies of Types and Interfaces when it comes to Props. Once this was figured out, Typescript became fairly easy to read and write.
Spending time refactoring code to split up components and create seperate API-related functions gave me a few ideas on how to start a project next time.

At the end of the day, the main technologies used to create this project are React, Typescript, React-Router, and Bootstrap (not including the other tools of the MERN stack used for the API). `create-react-app` boilerplate was used to minimize setup time and reduce initial confusions when starting a Typescript app for the first time.
